# Dyslexic-Color-Overlay
Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey script to provide color overlays that are claimed to help dyslexic people

It is claimed that the use of coloured filters and lenses can alleviate visual distortions for people with dyslexia.
You should research this yourself.

I make no claims, medical or otherwise, and I'm not asking anything for the script. This script is free.
If this helps you, please let me know.
